# treehouseCodeReviewerInvoice

I tried pen and paper. The results were undesirable.

I scoped the web but found next to nothing that was free, awesome, and easy to use.

Next I threw together some HTML to make a table that I printed and filled out with a pen, but I still wasn't pleased with the finished product.

That's when I said "frack it" and decided to just build my own custom invoice app.

Place all of the items billable to Treehouse right here in one convenient and custumizable invoice.  The totals will be figured for you.  And your entries will be saved in local storage.

To use or just check out this app, visit my [Treehouse Code Reviewer Invoice](http://gitrobertpm.github.io/treehouseCodeReviewerInvoice/) on GitHub Pages.

Alternatively, feel free to clone this repo and use it locally on your machine.  Either way, the result is basically the same.  Your entries are placed in local storage, persist beyond the current instance, and totals update as you go.
